        "a": "High leakage—unsuitable for oscillators.",
        "b": "Form factor, not quality.",
        "c": "Not necessary unless high voltage involved.",

      "question": "For sustaining oscillations in an oscillator",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Feedback factor should be negative and phase shift should be 0 or nπ",
        "b": "Phase shift should be unity and phase shift should be 0 or π/2",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect—feedback must be positive.",
        "b": "Incorrect wording—gain should be unity, not phase shift.",
