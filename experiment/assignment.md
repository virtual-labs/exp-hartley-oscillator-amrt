## Assignment


<ol>
  <li>Design a Hartley Oscillator for a free-running frequency of 1000 KHz and amplitude of 5V.</li>
  <li>The component values of a Hartley oscillator are C = 100 pF, L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>2</sub> = 100 μH. Compute its free-running frequency.</li>
  <li>In a transistorized Hartley oscillator, the two inductances are 2 mH and 20 μH while the frequency is to be changed from 950 kHz to 2050 kHz. Calculate the range over which the capacitor is to be varied.</li>
  <li>A Hartley oscillator circuit has L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>2</sub> = 100 μH. The frequency of oscillations required is 50 kHz. Calculate the value of the capacitance required.</li>
  <li>In a Hartley oscillator, the value of the capacitor in the tuned circuit is 500 pF and the two sections of coil have inductances 38 μH and 12 μH. Find the frequency of oscillations and feedback factor β.</li>
